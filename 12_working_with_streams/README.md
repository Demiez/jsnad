# WORKING WITH STREAMS

Streams implement high volume data processing without requiring huge compute resources. Streams provide an ergonomy by supporting the decoupling of application logic around real time data using a functional programming paradigm.

### Stream types

The Node core stream module exposes six constructors for creating streams:

- Stream
- Readable
- Writable
- Duplex
- Transform
- PassThrough
